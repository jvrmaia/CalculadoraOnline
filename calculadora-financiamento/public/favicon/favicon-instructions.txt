To create a proper favicon.ico file:

1. Open the house-emoji.html file in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the emoji (make sure it's square)
3. Use an online favicon generator like https://favicon.io/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
4. Upload your screenshot
5. Download the generated favicon package
6. Replace the files in the favicon directory with the generated ones

For now, we're using the SVG directly as the favicon, which works in modern browsers but may not work in all browsers.
